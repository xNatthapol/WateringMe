# WateringMe

The WateringMe project seeks to integrate various data points to determine the optimal watering requirements for plants.  
By analyzing factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness.  
This factor indicates the urgency and quantity of water needed by each plant,
promoting efficient water usage and healthier plant growth.
